          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            LOQ, short for List of Questions, is an online platform that allows
            users of all ages to create, share, and play quizzes with others
            around the world. With LOQ, users can create their own custom
            quizzes with custom questions, answers, images, and videos, all for
            completely free. Quizzes can be set to public, unlisted, or private,
            with private quizzes only visible to the creator when logged into
            their account. These Terms of Service ("ToS") apply to your use of
            the LOQ website (the "Site"), which is owned and operated by Micah
            Friedman ("we", "us", "our", or "LOQ"). By accessing or using the
            Site, you agree to be bound by these ToS, as well as our Privacy
